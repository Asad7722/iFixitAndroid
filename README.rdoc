== CONTRIBUTING

This app is a native android version of the iFixit website.  We offer native
browsing of our guides as well as integrated web views of our site with Answers
and our Cart.  We've got some fun experimental features we're playing around
with like Voice Command for navigating through guides.

We have a small development team, and don't have the resources to do all of these
ourselves. We'd love help! If any of those problems looks interesting to you, fork our
code and hack away!

Got an awesome feature idea that we don't have an API to support yet? Post the request on
meta.ifixit.com and we'll add it to our to-do list.

=== INSTALLATION

To start working on the app follow these instructions to download and update
the latest version of our code:

   git clone https://github.com/iFixit/iFixitAndroid.git 
   cd ./iFixitAndroid
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Then, to bring it into eclipse:

1) Start a new workspace at the base of the repository in Eclipse

2) Import... Existing Projects into Workspace and select the base of the repository

3) Clean all projects if there are any issues
